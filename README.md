# TRIP Steel TC Python Library (and runner scripts)

For 3.041 (Computational Design of Materials) @ MIT, we investigated modelling and designing the material properties of a printable TRIP Steel alloy.

To do this, we primarily rely on a TCPython (ThermoCalc for Python) module to facilitate large batches of calculations (as opposed to the GUI, which is great for single point calculations)

This repo is a compilation of refined scripts that I have helped write in order for painless yet transparent code to be written and read, to allow the science to be focused on instead of coding.
